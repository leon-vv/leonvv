A twenty-something, who spends too much time trying to understand the universe, and who makes a living telling computers what to do.

<h2>Software</h2>

<div class='software'>
<a href="https://github.com/leon-vv/Todo">Todo</a> - A todo list implemented using dependent types<br />

To get a program bug free people decided to sink an entire proof system in <a href="https://www.idris-lang.org/">a programming language</a>. I decided to test how well such a proof system works for getting a web application bug free (spoiler: pretty well). Don't miss out on <a href="https://github.com/leon-vv/Sql">a subset of SQL</a> built up in a completely type safe manner.

<a href="https://github.com/leon-vv/Pyka">Pyka</a> - A more powerful Lisp language<br />

In programming an expression like 'a + b' is evaluated in an <i>environment</i> which defines the values of the variables used in the expression. But what if you could manipulate the environments like any other data in your program? Like pass them around, change them or evaluate expressions inside them. I figured out that many of the most powerful programming constructs like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp#Macros">macros</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scope_vs._dynamic_scope_2">lexical scoping</a> can be implemented using such <i>first class environments</i>.
